    <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
        <h5 class="path"><a href="https://smasho.xyz/">Home</a> > <a href="https://smasho.xyz/mw.html">Meme Wars App</a> > <a href="https://smasho.xyz/mw/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></h5>

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3 class="last-updated">Last Revised: 27 May 2024</h3>

        <ol>
            <!--1. INTRODUCTION -->
            <li><b class="white">Introduction</b>
                <p>We are dedicated to ensuring everyone feels comfortable knowing what we know when you use the Meme Wars Application! If you care about this, then please continue reading. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information the App collects, how it is collected, and who has access to it.</p>

                <p>All definitions stated in the <a href="https://smasho.xyz/mw/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> apply here as well unless stated otherwise.</p>
            </li>

            <!-- 2. INFORMATION COLLECTION -->
            <li><b class="white">Information Collection</b>
                <ol>

                    <!-- 2.1. GLOBAL -->
                    <li><strong class="white">Global</strong>
                        <p>Nothing is recorded outside of the Server unless it has not been authorized (see 2.4. Unauthorized Use). Data that Server managers set up (custom prompts and custom prefixes) can be accessed outside of the Server by us, but unless we have proof or reasonable suspicion that they violate the Server’s rules and/or <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord's Terms of Service</a>, we will never access this data.</p>
                    </li>

                    <!-- 2.2. SERVER EVENTS -->
                    <li><strong class="white">Server Events</strong>
                        <p>None of the data in this section is ever recorded outside of the Server.</p>

                        <p>Server owners, or anyone with the Manage Server permission in a server with the Application, can use the Application’s text commands to allow it to record certain events events inside the Server, which is disabled by default:</p> 
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>/echo messages.</strong> If you execute the /echo command and /echo logs are enabled, Meme Wars will record the message, your username and ID, and the channel the message was sent in or to. Messages are automatically blocked from sending and logged if you attempt to send a message to an Important channel, or if the Application detects "@everyone", "@here", or an invite link to a Discord server.</li>
                                <li><strong>Welcome messages.</strong> If you join a server Meme Wars is a member of and welcome logs are enabled, It will log your profile, whether it is your first time joining the Server, whether your account is at least seven days old, and, if you joined the Meme Wars server, whether the App's welcome DM could be sent to you. This is simply to help the managers of the Server know who joined.</li>
                                <li><strong>Leave messages.</strong> If you leave a server Meme Wars is a member of and leave logs are enabled, It will log your profile and ID, the number of messages you sent, and, if you were banned from the Server via the App, the reason for the ban, if any is provided. This is simply to help the managers of the Server know who left.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Anyone with the Manage Server permission can opt-out by running the respective text command in any Channel the Application has access to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To opt-out of /echo logs: (prefix) reset log</li>
                                <li>To opt-out of welcome messages: (prefix) reset joinchannel</li>
                                <li>Opt-out of leave messages: (prefix) reset leavechannel</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>For the commands above, replace "(prefix)" with your Server's custom prefix—if none is set, use "!mw", as it is the default prefix.
                    </li>

                    <!-- 2.3. UNAUTHORIZED USE -->
                    <li><strong class="white">Unauthorized Use</strong>
                        <p>At the time of this document’s latest revision, Meme Wars is marked as private. Adding the App to any Server without our prior consent is strictly forbidden. If It is somehow added to a Server without prior consent and a slash command is used, Meme Wars will send us the command that was ran, the user who ran it, and some info about the Server wherein the command was executed. This allows us to beter understand the Server the Application was added to by providing essential information without requiring us to join it. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://smasho.xyz/mw/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, section 3. Restrictions for actions we may then take.</p>
                    </li>

                    <!-- 2.4. METHODS OF COLLECTION -->
                    <li><strong class="white">Methods of Collection</strong>
                        <p>By using the Application’s Services, you agree that your username and user ID may be recorded automatically if you execute a command in an unauthorized Server or are the owner of the Server in that same scenario. If you do not consent, please do not use the Application’s Services.</p>
                    </li>

                    <!-- 2.5. USE OF DATA -->
                    <li><strong class="white">Use of Data</strong>

                </ol>
            </li>
